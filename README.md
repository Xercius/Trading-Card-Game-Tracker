As a home project and learning experience I am building a web app to run locally on my PC to track my trading card collections. This will also include tracking deck construction, wish lists, and hopefully collection/deck values.
The goal is to eventually incorporate cards from the following games:
--Magic the Gathering
--Star Wars Unlimited
--Disney Lorcana
--Flesh and Blood
--Star Wars CCG
--Guardians
--Dicemasters
